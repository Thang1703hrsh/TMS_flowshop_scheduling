# flowshop_scheduling_problem
This is an implemention for some algorithms to solve a Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem (PFSP) using exact methods (**Johnson's Rule**, **Branch And Bound**) and Heuristic algorithms (**Palmer**, **CDS**, **NEH**) and genetic algorithm.

## NOTE

Not all algorithms are implemented in this repo. Until now, only **johnson's** algorithm, **Palmer's** heuristic, **CDS** and **NEH** heuristic are implemented.


## Deployment

A python virtual environement is strongly advised (Optional)

1. Install requirements

```bash
pip install flask plotly numpy
```

or Install using __requirements.txt__ file

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Built With

1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
2. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
3. [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)

## TODO

1. Make Benchmarks' comparisons
